## About
For those who love to shred. Browse a combination of guitar pedals and skateboard decks

## Challenges
Nav bar position and getting the images to get the right fit for the box. The best solution was to wrap each element in its own class and give it a width of 100% then adjust position.

## Wins
```word-wrap: break-word``` and ```background-color: hsla()```

## Color palette
Taken from a color of cherry red guitar. Added a bit of yellow and grey.
