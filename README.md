## About
There are 2 ways to be shredtacular- ride the board or play the stringed instrument through killer sound effects and a loud amp! Born 2 Shred allows users to browse both pedals and decks to build their own pedal board.

## Challenges
It took me a long time to figure out the nav bar position alone. The best solution was to wrap each element in its own class and give it a width of 100% then adjust position.

## Wins
Discovered ```word-wrap: break-word``` for the link box and used ```background-color: hsla()``` to add transparency with lightness to each article.

## Color palette
Inspired by a color of cherry red BC Rich Warlock guitar. Added yellow and grey for minimum playfulness.
